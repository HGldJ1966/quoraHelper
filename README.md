# quoraHelper
This is a chrome extension app, its release version is on [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quora-helper/opifbghfjnlmobgphdnhppdoldbalffo)

This extension is really simple.
After you install it, nothing seems happened. But when you are viewing Quora.com, which is a great website, it
helps you use j/k to move around.
 
Use j to move forward to next question or answer.
Use k to move backward to the previous one.
Use Enter to open the comments, or open 'more', or just open the editor to write answers.

Hope you like it.
Any usage or bug report would be appreciated.
